# <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:36px;">Virtual Mouse</span>

A virtual mouse is software that allows users to give mouse inputs to a system without using an actual mouse. It provides an alternative way to interact with the system, using image processing techniques and input devices like web cameras. With a virtual mouse, users can perform mouse operations without physically moving a physical mouse.
